# ASCT+B-converter

The Impact of Weatherization on Microbial Ecology and Human Health
=================================================

## Introduction 

This repository contains a jupyter script that given a ASCT+B Table will processs the table and generate a text (tsv) file where the first column is the cell type and the following columns are the gene markers. Proteins markers will be added soon.

## Overview
Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) tables aim to capture the nested part_of structure of anatomical human body parts, the typology of cells, and biomarkers used to identify cell types (e.g., gene, protein, lipid or metabolic markers). The tables are authored and reviewed by an international team of anatomists, pathologists, physicians, and other experts.
